Step 1

filter out the females that are fertile

#do this as findFertileFemales()

Step 2

initialize arrays and 'timeTaken'

fertileFemlae
oldFemale
children

Step 3

Append into children = no. of fertile female * Birth factor

#do this as a function breed()

Step 4

increase timeTaken by 'Time to Breed'

increase the age of children by 'time to breed'
increase the age of females by 'time to breed'
increase the age of males by 'time to breed'

Step 5

check if any female has reached life expectancy, if yes remove it from females array
check if any child has reached maturity age, if yes shift it to females array

Step 6

if((males+females+children)>=threshold value):
	then display
